In general, there is a five step process that can be used each type you want to use a supervised learning method.

<ul>
<li> Import the model.</li> 
<li> Instantiate the model with the hyperparameters of interest.</li>
<li> Fit the model to the training data.</li>
<li> Predict on the test data. </li>
<li> Score the model by comparing the predictions to the actual values. </li>
</ul> 

 In this example, the above said setps are followed for each of the ensemble methods: BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and AdaBoostClassifier.

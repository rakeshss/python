In general, there is a five step process that can be used each type you want to use a supervised learning method (which you actually used above):

    Import the model.
    Instantiate the model with the hyperparameters of interest.
    Fit the model to the training data.
    Predict on the test data.
    Score the model by comparing the predictions to the actual values.

 In this example, the same above said methods are followed for each of the ensemble methods: BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and AdaBoostClassifier.
